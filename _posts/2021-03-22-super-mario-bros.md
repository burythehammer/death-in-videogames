Game setup:
------

Super Mario Bros. is a 2D sidescrolling platformer. Mario must traverse the Mushroom Kingdom, which has been invaded by King Koopa's army, to rescue Princess Toadstool.

How death is represented:
------

- Systemic: The player dies when either hit with no power-ups, or falls down a bottomless pit. Dying causes a life to be lost. The player starts with 3 lives and can gain more with a 1-UP mushroom, or by obtaining 100 coins.
- Systemic: Mario can defeat many kinds of enemies by jumping on them, shooting fire at them, and in the case of King Koopa, plunging them into pits of lava. It is ambiguous whether this "defeat" really means death, as King Koopa returns throughout the game.
- Thematic / narrative: Death is almost completely avoided from a thematic and narrative perspective, owing to its target audience.

Tone:
------
- Childlike
- Fantastical
- Surreal

Analysis:
------

Super Mario Bros. might be one of the most famous and influential videogames of all time. It was the launch title of the Famicom / NES consoles, is the reference point for every sidescrolling 2D platformer after it, and has sold tens of millions of copies worldwide.

Super Mario Bros. is marketed for an audience which includes children, so it should be expected that it largely sidesteps the issue of death, except from a purely systemic fashion. Death of the player character is a fail state, but one that is temporary due to the lives system - a system popular at the time due to arcades, which would require players to insert more money if they wish to continue. In this case, lives really represent "continues". A more true death / failure state occurs when the player runs out of lives, at which the game is over. Since there are no continues, or save points, the player is forced to start over from the beginning of the game.

Given that Super Mario Bros. is not a particularly long game - and can be completed in mere minutes with skillful play (the world record as of writing stands at 4:55), the lives system greatly increases the amount of time an average player will spend playing it. By introducing a skill barrier, players are forced to improve their skill in order to progress - and the gameplay loop will typically involve a player trying again and again to get to the end.

The way in which death is represented, in the forms of animations and sound, paint death as cartoon violence. Death is annoying, potentially sad - even more so in the case of a Game Over - but not given the weight one would give death in a real world or narrative sense. As for his enemies, Mario defeats them, but it is highly ambiguous whether this even means death, or is merely a temporary setback for them as well. King Koopa is defeated multiple times (it is commonly held that all but the last are decoys), but even so, he returns in subsequent Mario games, as if nothing had ever happened.

This fits neatly with the audience and world of Super Mario - it is a world free of serious consequences, which avoids adult themes entirely. Death in this world is systemic, and is more a convenient term for failure states (both for the player and enemies) than a serious, consequential topic to discuss.
