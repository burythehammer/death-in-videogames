Game Setup
------

Dishonored is a 3D action adventure game with a heavy focus on stealth and assassination. The player takes on the role of Corvo Attano, who seeks revenge after being framed for the murder of an empress he is sworn to protect. The game is set in Dunwall, a fictional steampunk city inspired by Victorian London, which is beset by a mysterious plague.

How death is represented
------

- Narrative: Within the first few minutes of the game, the player witnesses the assassination of the Empress.
- Narrative: Depending on the options the player takes, many NPCs can be either directly killed or die as a result of the player’s actions.
- Narrative: The plague infecting the city is killing many of its poor citizens.
- Systematic: The player dies when they run out of health, and is forced to reload a save. Saves can be taken at any time, so this is a minor inconvenience.
- Systematic: The player can choose to kill or spare all hostile targets in the game. Killing is generally easier but adds to a “chaos” score. A higher chaos score affects many aspects of the game, including more enemies and darker narrative results.
- Thematic: The plague which infects the city, and is spread by rats, is inspired by the Black Death, the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history.
- Thematic: The technological superiority of Dunwall is entirely down to the magical properties of whale oil, which is harvested by the slaughter of whales.

Tone:

- Dark
- Bleak

Analysis
------

Dishonored is a game rife with death. Within the first moments of the game, you witness an empress being murdered. Your character is framed for that crime and put on death row. To escape prison you (optionally) slaughter guards on your way out. Meanwhile, a plague ravages the city, and the corpses line the streets. However, narrative points aside, perhaps the most interesting thing that Dishonored does with death is systemic.

Games that have stealth in often give the player a choice whether or not to kill enemy characters. A common design is to discourage player kills, and to reward a gameplay style that incapacitates enemies. Killing is often easier, but has fewer rewards. This can be a fine line, and how the game mechanically implements this can drastically change the gameplay loop. Some give you higher scores, or give you better rewards, or achievements, or specific narrative outcomes. Sometimes, the game is simply less fun. Dishonored, instead, weaves the player’s killing into the fabric of the narrative world.

At the end of each level a “chaos score” is displayed. This score represents how many enemies the player has killed, and whether the player decided to kill or spare the target/s of the mission (it also represents some other things, but these have a minor effect). In essence, it is the amount of death the player has caused. The average chaos score can change (up or down) throughout the game, and its current level drastically changes the world and the narrative outcomes of the game in a fluid manner. The more people the player kills, the world reacts by becoming darker and more manevelent. This manifests in some obvious ways: NPCs disapprove of the players actions, and to see the “good” ending, you need to have not killed too many people. Much more interestingly however, death seeps into the very fabric of the world. The plague starts to advance rapidly, leading to more rats, more “weepers” (zombie-like plague victims), and more corpses lining the streets. Characters start to become less rational, more filled with hate and paranoia, and more outwardly aggressive. The death that the player introduces into the world begets more and more death.

_Spoilers follow._

Thus, it is unsurprising that the “bad ending” follows from a high chaos playthrough - narratively, Dunwall has become a dark and unsettling place, full of madmen, killers and plague. You’ve simply introduced too much death into the world for it to recover.
