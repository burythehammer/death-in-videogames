The gameplay is management based, focusing on gathering resources, platforming, and navigating a ship. The goal is to make these souls happy and cared for, so that they can peacefully transition to the afterlife.
How death is represented Narrative: NPCs die and then pass to the afterlife Narrative: Player character dies and passes to the afterlife Thematic: Strong overtones of palliative care Tone Explorative Peaceful Contemplative, reflective Emotional Analysis The role of a psychopomp in videogames tends to be relegated to an NPC perspective in videogames, so it is an unusual approach to have the player assume that role.</description></item></channel></rss>
